It's become clear that people want to talk about Valkey and have been publishing blog posts/articles fervently.
Here you'll find a collection of all the post I'm aware of in the last few weeks.

## Percona

The kind folks over at Percona have been on an absolutely legendary streak of posting about Valkey.
They've done a series on data types ([Hashes](https://www.percona.com/blog/valkey-redis-the-hash-datatype/), [Sorted Sets](https://www.percona.com/blog/valkey-redis-sets-and-sorted-sets/)), [best](https://www.percona.com/blog/valkey-redis-configuration-best-practices/) and [not-so-good practices](https://www.percona.com/blog/valkey-redis-not-so-good-practices/), [getting started](https://www.percona.com/blog/hello-valkey-lets-get-started/), [replication/failover](https://www.percona.com/blog/valkey-redis-replication-and-auto-failover-with-sentinel-service/), [configurations/persistence](https://www.percona.com/blog/valkey-redis-configurations-and-persistent-setting-of-the-key-parameters/), and finally their own [Valkey packages for DEB and RPM-based repos](https://www.percona.com/blog/hello-valkey-lets-get-started/).

## Fedora Magazine

Yours truly wrote a post for Fedora Magazine published just today about using the valkey-compat-redis package to move to Valkey

## Community.aws

Ricardo Ferreira put together a [walkthrough of using Valkey with Go on Docker](https://community.aws/content/2fdr6Vg8BiJS8jr8xsuQRRc0MD5/getting-started-with-valkey-using-docker-and-go).

## The New Stack

While Open Source Summit North America was last month, [The New Stack published a blog post about Valkey](https://thenewstack.io/valkey-a-redis-fork-with-a-future/) and accompany interview with project leaders, it's worth a watch and read.

## Presentation: Digging into Valkey

On the subject of Open Source Summit, the talk I gave along side Madelyn Olsen, ["Digging into Valkey" was posted as a video](https://youtu.be/3G6QgwIl-xs).
